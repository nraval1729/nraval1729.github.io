title: Hello World!

I just finished setting up my blog!

I've been wanting to do this for a long time now, and I had always procrastinated in the past. I checked out different platforms 
like 
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but never really got around to actually 
setting this up. I then stumbled upon [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), and it checked all my boxes:
* Simple to set up &#9745;
* Simple to use &#9745;
* No learning curve &#9745;
* Free &#9745;

I made this checklist because I wanted to focus on expressing myself without having to worry about the internals of the blogging platform I use.

Have a good day!
